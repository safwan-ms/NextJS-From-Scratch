### Exercise 1: Draggable Box

Create a draggable box that updates its position using `useMotionValue`.

1. Create a `motion.div` that can be dragged around.
2. Use `useMotionValue` to track the x and y position of the box.
3. Display the current position of the box as text.

### Exercise 2: Hover-Linked Scale

Create a button that scales up when hovered, using `useMotionValue`.

1. Create a `motion.button`.
2. Use `useMotionValue` to control the scale of the button.
3. Update the scale value on hover and reset it when not hovered.

### Exercise 3: Spring-Animated Position

Create a box that springs to a new position when clicked, using `useMotionValue`.

1. Create a `motion.div` that can be clicked to move to a new position.
2. Use `useMotionValue` to control the x and y position.
3. Animate the box to the new position with a spring effect.

### Exercise 24: Dynamic Rotation

Create a component that rotates based on a motion value.

1. Create a `motion.div` that rotates when a button is clicked.
2. Use `useMotionValue` to track the rotation angle.
3. Animate the rotation of the box based on the motion value.
